	<h1>FCSC Redistricting</h1>
	<p>As Fayette County School Corporation works on redistricting, there has been a lot of data and maps produced. The data are largely unavailable to the public and the maps are locked in PDF files. This site is a citizen-led effort to grant access to the data behind these redistricting proposals to ALL citizens of Fayette County.</p>
	<p>Efforts to contact FCPS about gaining access to the geographic data produced by Davis Demographics &amp; Planning, Inc. have gone unanswered. However, by leveraging current school district boundary data from <a href="http://data.lexingtonky.gov/">Lexington's Open Data Portal</a>, PDF maps from FCPS's <a href="http://www.fcps.net/zones">redistricting page</a>, and FOSS mapping applicatons like <a href="">QGIS</a> and <a href="">GeoJSON.io</a>, we have attempted to recreate the data being used by FCPS.</p>
